# Employee-Payroll-System
The provided Java code encapsulates a basic payroll management system. It comprises several classes organized within the com.payroll.management package. At its core lies the abstract class Employee, serving as a blueprint for different employee types. Each employee, whether full-time or part-time, is represented by a concrete subclass extending Employee. The FullTimeEmployee class models full-time employees, while PartTimeEmployee caters to part-time ones. Both subclasses override the abstract method calculateSalary() to compute their respective salaries. The PayrollSystem class orchestrates the management of employees, maintaining them within an ArrayList and offering methods to add, remove, and display employee details. Finally, the Main class orchestrates a demonstration of the system's functionality, creating instances of employees, adding them to the payroll system, and showcasing employee details before and after removal. Overall, this system provides a structured approach to handle payroll operations for diverse employee types within an organization.
